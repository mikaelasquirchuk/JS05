var noun = "day";
var num = 2;

if (num === 1) {
    console.log(num+ " "+noun);
} else if (
    noun.endsWith("s") || 
    noun.endsWith("x") || 
    noun.endsWith("z") || 
    noun.endsWith("ch") || 
    noun.endsWith("sh")) {
        console.log(num+" "+noun+"es");
} else if (
    noun.endsWith("y") && 
    (noun.charAt(noun.length - 2) != "a" &&
    noun.charAt(noun.length - 2)  != "e" &&
    noun.charAt(noun.length - 2) != "i" &&
    noun.charAt(noun.length - 2) != "o" &&
    noun.charAt(noun.length - 2) != "u")) {
        console.log(num+" "+noun.slice(0,(noun.length - 1))+"ies");
} else {
    console.log(num+" "+noun+"s");
}
