// ## A Transit Application

// Start with this data...

// ```js
// var stations = ["Museum", "St. James", "Circular Quay", "Wynyard", "Townhall", "Central", "Redfern", "Macdonaldtown", "Newtown"];
// ```

// Create a function called `travelFrom` that receives a start station and an end station.

// * Print the number of stops between the two stations. (e.g. log out "To go from 'Circular Quay' to 'Central' - you'll need to go through 2 stops")
// * Print out the names of the stations on separate lines (e.g. log out "- Circular Quay", "- Wynyard", "- Townhall", "- Central")

// ### Bonus

// * Make this work if you want to go backwards! e.g. You want to travel from "Redfern" to "St. James"
// * Make it error-tolerant. E.g.:
//   * Make it case-insensitive - there should be no difference between "redfern", "Redfern" and "REDFERN"
//   * If someone passes in a station that doesn't exist, tell them
// * Make it work across lines! I'll leave it up to you to create the data you need - but create arrays of multiple train lines in Sydney, and try it to get to print out the same things as above - but also things like "Swap lines at ....."
//   * This will be very, very difficult! Don't feel like you have to add in all the lines, just a few to prove that it is working
//   * Look at the hints below

// #### Hints 

// * You can receive the name of the line! (e.g. `travelFrom("t2", "Circular Quay", "t3", "Canterbury")`)
// * Find the common station! (e.g. t2 and t3 both have "Central")
//   * Maybe drawing out the lines is a good approach!
// * One of the easiest approaches to this is to treat a trip across lines as two separate trips
// * An object with arrays stored under the name of the train lines might be a good way to approach it (e.g. `var sydneyTrains = { t1: [], t2: [] };`
//   * Note that if you want to use a variable to decide which line to access - dot notation won't work on an object! You'll have to think of another way...
// * Ask me questions about this if you want though!
// * Work together as well - even if it is just in the planning stages
