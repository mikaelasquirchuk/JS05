//Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
//Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numberOfChildren = 22;
var partnersName = "Javier";
var geographicLocation = "Nantucket";
var jobTitle = "Space Invader";
