### Programming vs Coding

* Coding is the practice of writing in a language that a computer interprets to perform a task. It requires knowledge of a specific language.
* Programming is the ability to solve problems, or rather, instruct a device to be able to solve problems. â€‹This is shared between languages.

### Pseudocode

* Pseudocode is the language we use when writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language
* It's a universal programming language for humans
* It is a way to plan - essentially a shorthand we use before we write a program
